# Perceptron on Iris Dataset

This project implements a basic Perceptron classifier applied to the Iris dataset. 
The project demonstrates a binary classification task distinguishing Iris-setosa from other classes. 

## Project Structure

- `source/`: Contains main code (`main.py`) and package initializer.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the perceptron implementation.
- `.gitignore`: Standard Python ignores.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `Makefile`: Optional commands to run tests or main program.

## Features

- Implementation of Perceptron from scratch using NumPy.
- Training and prediction on the Iris dataset.
- Scatter plot visualization of predicted classes.
- Basic unit tests for perceptron methods.

## Limitations

- Perceptron works only for linearly separable data.
- Currently only supports binary classification.
